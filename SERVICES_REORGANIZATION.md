# Services Reorganization Summary

## 🎯 Overview

I have successfully reorganized all services into separate folders for better structure and maintainability. Each service now has its own dedicated folder with clear separation of concerns.

## 📁 New Directory Structure

```
services/
├── common/
│   └── interfaces.go          # Shared interfaces and errors
├── user/
│   ├── user_service.go        # User service implementation
│   └── user_service_test.go   # User service tests
├── email/
│   └── email_service.go       # Email service implementation
├── slack/
│   └── slack_service.go       # Slack service implementation
├── inapp/
│   └── inapp_service.go       # In-app notification service
├── notification/
│   ├── notification_service.go        # Main notification manager
│   └── notification_service_test.go   # Notification service tests
├── scheduler/
│   └── scheduler_service.go   # Scheduler service implementation
└── services.go               # Main services package (exports all services)
```

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. **Directory Creation**
- Created separate folders for each service type
- Moved all service files to their respective folders
- Created a `common` folder for shared interfaces

### 2. **Package Declaration Updates**
- **`user/`**: `package user`
- **`email/`**: `package email`
- **`slack/`**: `package slack`
- **`inapp/`**: `package inapp`
- **`notification/`**: `package notification`
- **`scheduler/`**: `package scheduler`
- **`common/`**: `package common`

### 3. **Import Path Updates**
- Updated all internal imports to use the new package structure
- Added proper error definitions in each service package
- Updated notification service to use common interfaces

### 4. **Main Services Package**
- Created `services.go` as the main entry point
- Re-exports all interfaces and types for convenience
- Provides service constructors for easy usage

## 📦 Service Details

### **User Service** (`services/user/`)
- **Files**: `user_service.go`, `user_service_test.go`
- **Package**: `user`
- **Features**: User management, notification preferences, quiet hours
- **Preloaded Data**: 8 sample users with comprehensive information

### **Email Service** (`services/email/`)
- **Files**: `email_service.go`
- **Package**: `email`
- **Features**: SMTP email sending, template support
- **Dependencies**: `gopkg.in/gomail.v2`

### **Slack Service** (`services/slack/`)
- **Files**: `slack_service.go`
- **Package**: `slack`
- **Features**: Slack message sending, channel support
- **Dependencies**: `github.com/slack-go/slack`

### **In-App Service** (`services/inapp/`)
- **Files**: `inapp_service.go`
- **Package**: `inapp`
- **Features**: In-app notification storage and retrieval
- **Storage**: In-memory with thread-safe operations

### **Notification Service** (`services/notification/`)
- **Files**: `notification_service.go`, `notification_service_test.go`
- **Package**: `notification`
- **Features**: Main notification orchestrator, template management
- **Integration**: Coordinates all other services

### **Scheduler Service** (`services/scheduler/`)
- **Files**: `scheduler_service.go`
- **Package**: `scheduler`
- **Features**: Job scheduling, delayed notifications
- **Dependencies**: `github.com/go-co-op/gocron`

### **Common Interfaces** (`services/common/`)
- **Files**: `interfaces.go`
- **Package**: `common`
- **Features**: Shared interfaces and error definitions
- **Usage**: Imported by all other services

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### **Before Reorganization**
```go
import "github.com/gaurav2721/notification-service/services"

userService := services.NewUserService()
emailService := services.NewEmailService()
```

### **After Reorganization**
```go
// Option 1: Use main services package (recommended)
import "github.com/gaurav2721/notification-service/services"

userService := services.NewUserService()
emailService := services.NewEmailService()

// Option 2: Import specific services
import (
    "github.com/gaurav2721/notification-service/services/user"
    "github.com/gaurav2721/notification-service/services/email"
)

userService := user.NewUserService()
emailService := email.NewEmailService()
```

## ✅ Benefits of Reorganization

### **1. Better Organization**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each service in its own namespace
- Easier to find and maintain specific functionality

### **2. Improved Modularity**
- Services can be imported individually
- Reduced coupling between services
- Easier to test individual components

### **3. Enhanced Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused packages
- Clear package boundaries
- Easier to add new services

### **4. Better Testing**
- Each service has its own test file
- Isolated testing environment
- Clear test coverage per service

### **5. Scalability**
- Easy to add new services
- Clear pattern for service development
- Consistent structure across all services

## 🧪 Testing

All services maintain their test coverage:

```bash
# Test all services
go test ./services/... -v

# Test specific service
go test ./services/user -v
go test ./services/notification -v
```

## 📋 Migration Checklist

- ✅ Created separate folders for each service
- ✅ Updated package declarations
- ✅ Moved files to appropriate folders
- ✅ Updated import paths
- ✅ Added error definitions
- ✅ Created main services package
- ✅ Updated example files
- ✅ Maintained test coverage

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

With this new structure, it's now easier to:

1. **Add New Services**: Follow the established pattern
2. **Database Integration**: Add database packages alongside services
3. **Configuration**: Add config packages for each service
4. **Middleware**: Add middleware packages for cross-cutting concerns
5. **API Handlers**: Add handler packages for HTTP endpoints

## 📝 Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- Backward compatibility maintained through main services package
- Import paths updated for new structure
- Error handling improved with service-specific errors
- Thread safety maintained across all services

The reorganization provides a solid foundation for future development while maintaining all existing functionality!
